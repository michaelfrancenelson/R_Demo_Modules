knitr can't process newcommands with arguments properly, they must be defined in an external tex file and then imported.

\input{`r here::here("css", "newcommands.tex")`}

# new command within Rmd file
\newcommand{\atest} { and seven years ago }
\atest

# new command from imported tex file

\logoSoutheast{`r here::here("images", "test", "iClicker_logo.png")`}
